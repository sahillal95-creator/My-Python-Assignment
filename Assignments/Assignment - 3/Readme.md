## Task 1: Factorial Using Recursion

This program defines a recursive function named `factorial()` that:

- Takes a non-negative integer as input
- Uses recursion to calculate the factorial
- Includes proper base cases:
  - factorial(0) = 1
  - factorial(1) = 1
- Handles invalid input using try-except
- Displays the calculated factorial

### Example:
Input: 5  
Output: Factorial of 5 is 120

## Task 2: Using the Math Module

This program:

- Accepts user input
- Uses Python’s built-in `math` module
- Calculates:
  - Square root
  - Natural logarithm (log base e)
  - Sine 
- Includes proper input validation

### Example:
Enter a number: 25  
Square Root of 25.0 = 5.0  
Natural Log of 25.0 = 3.2188758248682006  
Sine of 25.0 = -0.13235175009777303
