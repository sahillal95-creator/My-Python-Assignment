# Assignment - 5 


## Task 1
In this program, I created a dictionary of student names and their marks.
The user can enter a student name.
If the name exists in the dictionary, the program shows the marks.
If not, it displays a message that the student is not found.

## Task 2
In this program, I created a list of numbers from 1 to 10.
Then I extracted the first five elements using list slicing.
After that, I reversed those elements and printed both lists.
